                    which was
                    awesome. My wife had a burger over greens (gluten-free) which was also very good. They were very
                    conscientious about gluten allergies. The restaurant has a vey nice ambiance and a cozy bar.” –

                    couldn’t have been nicer. She was quick, efficient and friendly. She helped recommend something for
                    my dinner and the Lobster Florentine didn’t disappoint! I even returned the next morning for
                    breakfast and got similar service! It was a gem I found and can’t wait to return next year- I just
                    hope Erin is still bartending then!” – Venky
